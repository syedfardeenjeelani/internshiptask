# Internship Assignment

This repository contains my attempt at converting a Figma design into a fully functional and responsive web page using React and vanilla CSS.

## Objective

The goal of this assignment was to assess my ability to translate a design into a working web page. I was required to replicate the provided Figma design as closely as possible while adhering to specific requirements and guidelines.

## Requirements

1. **Framework**: React
2. **Styling**: Vanilla CSS (no CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or TailwindCSS)
3. **Layout**: Flexbox or CSS Grid for responsive layout
4. **Responsiveness**: The design should adapt to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, and desktop)

## Guidelines

1. **Code Structure**: Maintained a clean and organized file structure, follow appropriate naming conventions, and comment where necessary.
2. **Design Precision**: Matched the design as closely as possible in terms of layout, colors, fonts, and spacing, ensuring a pixel-perfect implementation.
3. **Responsiveness**: Used media queries to ensure the design adapts to different screen sizes, and test on multiple devices.
4. **Best Practices**: Followed best practices for React and CSS, ensure code is clean, well-documented, and optimized for performance.

## Submission

1. **GitHub Repository**: This public GitHub repository contains the project code.




## Note

Due to my ongoing exams, I could not complete the last and second-last page of the design. However, I have commented out the code for those pages in the repository. Additionally, I have used vanilla CSS for this project; if I had used a utility-first CSS framework like TailwindCSS, I might have been able to complete the assignment more efficiently.
